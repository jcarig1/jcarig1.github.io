            <h3>Microglia and HCN channel physiology in the Entorhinal Cortex</h3>
            <br>
            <img src = "/images/octocat.png" alt = "placeholder image" class = "float-start mb-3">
            <p>My work involves studying physiological interactions of microglia and neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) in mice. 
            In particular, I am interested in the role of the HCN (Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channel.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our lab has already found that HCN channels in layer III of the EC are critical for memory consolidation<sup>1</sup>.
            However, we have reason to believe that HCN channels play an important role in maintaining a healthy microenvironment in the 
            brain. My work uses a variety of methods, including in-vivo stereotaxic intracranial surgery, mixed primary-neuron and 
            glial culture, and western blotting and immunostaining to study the role of HCN channels in the EC.

            <h2>Methods Jacob uses</h2>
            <br>
            <img src = "/images/primary_neuron_culture_diagram.PNG" alt = "Cell Culture Image" class = "image-fluid mb-3">
            <h3>Primary Neuron and mixed glial cell culture</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Primary neuronal cultures are achieved by collecting the brains of neonatal mouse pups, dissecting the region of 
                interest (e.g. cortex, midbrain), dissociating the cells into a suspension, then plating them 
                on a substrate-coated surface such as a cell culture plate. Unlike other cell culture models such as 
                HEK (human embryonic kidney) cells, primary neurons are extremely limited in their ability to divide and reproduce,
                and further, cannot be immortalized. This requires the experimenter to collect fresh tissue for each new culture,
                and limits the duration of experiments to approximately 3 weeks before cells start to die. 
            <br>
            <p>I use a mixed neuronal and glial cell culture as an in-vitro model for my experiments. This allows me to more closely
                mimic the neural tissue microenvironment. I use this model primarily for pharmacological testing of time and 
                concentration dose-response curves. This reduces the number of animals required for in-vivo studies, as 
                each culture can produce more replicates for each time or dose. It also can provide initial results that can 
                inform later in-vivo work. While culture models are flexible and quick, they cannot fully mimic the in-vivo 
                environment, so they exist as a tool that is complementary and can play the role of a 'force-multiplier'.</p>
